# 🏠 StayNest

**StayNest** is a full-stack hybrid web application that helps students and professionals find affordable, verified, and comfortable accommodations (PGs, hostels, and co-living spaces) in cities across India.  

It combines a **React.js frontend** with a **PHP + MySQL backend**, making it fast, scalable, and easy to deploy locally through XAMPP.
